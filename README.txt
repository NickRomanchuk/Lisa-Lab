## ResearchDatesOrganizer.py ##
This scripts imports the excel document 'LEO Aim 3 - CRC Project Breeding & Test Dates.xlsx'.
This excel document has the dates for when different activities (columns) for each mice (rows) need to be completed.
When you run the script it will prompt you for a start date, followed by an end date.
It will then produce a text document 'mice_dates.txt' which has the dates (within the provided window [inclusive]) and all the activites for the corresponding mice that need to be completed on those days.
This script allows you to quickly see what activities need to be done on any given day without scanning through the whole excel sheet.
